## Overview

Investors Dream is a Tauri-based desktop application with a Next.js frontend, designed to help users track and analyze daily changes in U.S. stocks within the S&P 500 index. The app was born from a need to easily visualize stock movements and track market trends without relying on complicated tools. Users can filter stocks based on key financial metrics, save favorites to a "Playground" page, and explore sentiment analysis through Reddit threads.
## Key Features
- **Stock Visualization:** A streamlined UI for visualizing daily changes in S&P 500 stocks, helping users to quickly grasp market trends.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Stocks can be filtered by Market Cap, Price Targets, PE Ratio, FPE, and other essential financial metrics.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrated Reddit browsing to gauge investor sentiment and trends on specific stocks.
- **User-Friendly Setup**: Easily clone and configure the application; contributors can use their own API keys by adjusting the sensitive_constants.rs file, preventing unintentional key sharing.
## Technologies Used

- **Tauri:** For secure, lightweight desktop app development with seamless integration with web technologies.
- **React.js:** As the frontend framework, providing efficient page rendering and a modern developer experience.
- **Rust:** For the backend logic within Tauri, offering high performance and secure handling of API calls.

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge was managing sensitive data, such as API keys, within a desktop application, while keeping the setup user-friendly for contributors. This required a creative approach to ensure smooth data management and build processes. Implementing sentiment analysis through Reddit browsing was another learning experience, highlighting the nuances of using social data to interpret market sentiment.
## Outcome

Investors Dream has become a valuable tool for personal stock analysis, helping to demystify financial market trends for myself. By providing clear visualization tools and customizable filters, the app supports users in making informed investment decisions.
